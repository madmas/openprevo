== Cross-cutting Concepts


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are
relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* domain models
* architecture patterns or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of overall decisions
* implementation rules

.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity)
of the architecture. Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks
(e.g. security or safety). This is the place in the template that we provided for a
cohesive specification of such concepts.

.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

=== Security

Since we're operating on very sensitive information, security is an important aspect of this project.

==== Authentication

In a later stage of the product, we need end-to-end encryption. As an example it needs to be possible to send encrypted data from one VE (A) to an other (B) and only B should be able to read (decrypt) the data. Therefore, we decided to use asymmetric encryption to secure the data. This means that we won't implement a classic authentication in the beginning. We simply make sure that only the correct participant can read the data.

==== Asymmetric Encryption

To encrypt the data asymmetrically, we're using the **RSA** algorithm. Each participant of the OpenPrevo system needs to have a private and public-key pair.

The public key will be stored on the OpenPrevo Hub and can be distributed to all participants. The private key must not leave a VEs environment.

NOTE: Depending on the amount of data we need to encrypt, we might have to use symmetrical encryption for the data and exchange the symmetric key via RSA. This will be decided depending on the attributes to use for the matching.

==== Public Key Registry

Every VE needs to register its public key on our OpenPrevo Hub. So the Hub will manage all public keys of every VE.

==== Hashing

According to data protection guidelines in Switzerland we are not allowed to read any personal data of an insured person on our platform. Therefore, a VE is responsible for sending us only a _hash_ of their data.
